# MovieStoreMVC-using-EF

This is my first project in asp.net core MVC using EntityFramework Core, one of the most popular free and opensource Framework developed by microsoft.
This project is carried out as a part of my assignment after completing 2.5month training in Broadway infosys. 

In this Project admin can add, edit, and delet the genre, And it include a form for defining the movie Title, Genre(ie. two tables genre table and movie Table are mapped together),
gives the names of director, cast info, upload a cover image of movie and so on. Which is then render in a beautiful boostrap card in home page and its visible to everyone.
here,  IndentityFramework is used to maintain a Adminrole.. One can directly login using
Usernama: admin
password: Admin@123

which is directly assigned in the UserAuthenticationController in Register Action instead of asking and registering from the views(webPage).
